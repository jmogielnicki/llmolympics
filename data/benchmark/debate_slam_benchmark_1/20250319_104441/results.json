        "current_argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, let's address the core issues raised by my opponent. While they argue that tariffs provide necessary short-term protection for domestic industries, this perspective overlooks the broader implications these tariffs have on our economy and society.\n\nFirst, the idea that tariffs offer \"breathing room\" for industries ignores how quickly these measures can backfire. Retaliatory tariffs cannot always be mitigated through negotiations, often resulting in more harm than good for our exporters, ultimately reducing global market access. This is not just a theoretical risk but a recurring reality in global trade.\n\nSecond, the notion that tariffs prevent job losses fails to consider the consumer side of the equation. Higher costs from tariffs mean less disposable income, reducing consumption and hurting sectors reliant on consumer spending. While a few industries might temporarily benefit, the broader economy suffers as purchasing power diminishes.\n\nMoreover, my opponent\u2019s historical argument about strategic tariffs overlooks that innovation, not protectionism, secures our national security. Instead of inhibiting global competition, which drives progress, we should foster partnerships and invest in human capital and technology to ensure our industries' resilience against foreign pressures.\n\nIn closing, the path forward lies not in tariffs that might shield us momentarily but in strategies that enhance competitiveness and innovation, secure fair trade practices, and empower consumers and businesses alike. Let us choose a future built on these sustainable foundations rather than transient protections that stifle progress. Thank you.",

        "current_argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we reach the final round, let's reinforce the necessity of tariffs for protecting our domestic industries. My opponent argues that tariffs backfire due to retaliatory actions, but this risk can be managed through strategic trade negotiations and selective application of tariffs. The temporary \"breathing room\" provided by tariffs is essential for industries transitioning to more competitive practices, which ultimately benefits our economy.\n\nRegarding job preservation, my opponent focuses on the consumer's reduced purchasing power. However, without tariffs, the immediate threat to jobs from foreign competition is far more severe. The potential loss of entire sectors outweighs the temporary consumer cost increase. Tariffs ensure that our industries can maintain employment while adapting to global competition.\n\nOn national security, my opponent emphasizes innovation over protectionism. While innovation is crucial, it does not negate the need for tariffs. Strategic tariffs protect critical industries like steel, which are vital for our defense infrastructure. Without these measures, we risk undermining our national security by becoming overly dependent on foreign suppliers.\n\nIn conclusion, tariffs are not just about short-term protection but about ensuring long-term economic stability, job security, and national defense. They are a vital part of a comprehensive strategy that includes innovation and fair trade. Let us not dismiss the proven benefits of tariffs but integrate them wisely to safeguard our future.
