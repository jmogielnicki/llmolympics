        "current_argument": "Honorable judges, our opponent continues to downplay the crucial advantages of nuclear energy while overstating the capabilities of renewables. Let's be clear: relying solely on renewables is a gamble with the planet's future.\n\nThe \"time argument\" is a false dichotomy. While renewables can be deployed quickly, their intermittency necessitates backup systems \u2013 often fossil fuels \u2013 negating their climate benefits. Nuclear, on the other hand, provides continuous, carbon-free power for decades. SMRs are not \"theoretical\"; they are under development and deployment, promising faster construction times and greater flexibility. Building a resilient, decarbonized grid requires both rapid deployment and long-term reliability \u2013 something only nuclear can guarantee.\n\nRegarding economics, focusing solely on upfront costs ignores the bigger picture. The cost of intermittency \u2013 the need for massive overbuilding of renewables and expensive storage \u2013 is rarely factored in. Nuclear's levelized cost of energy, considering its lifespan and reliability, is competitive and becoming more so. Furthermore, the societal cost of climate change \u2013 extreme weather events, health impacts, and economic disruption \u2013 far outweighs the investment in nuclear infrastructure.\n\nThe opponent paints nuclear safety as an insurmountable problem, but this is fear-mongering. Modern reactors have multiple redundant safety systems, and the industry has learned from past mistakes. Nuclear waste, while requiring careful management, is a contained problem, unlike the continuous atmospheric pollution from fossil fuels.\n\nIn conclusion, while renewables are a valuable part of the energy mix, they cannot solve the climate crisis alone. Nuclear energy is the *best* solution because it offers the unique combination of scalability, reliability, and low-carbon emissions needed to power a sustainable future. We urge you to recognize the unparalleled value of nuclear energy in combating climate change.",

        "current_argument": "Esteemed judges, let me conclude by addressing the fundamental problem with nuclear as \"the best\" climate solution: its opportunity cost.\n\nThe climate crisis isn't abstract \u2013 it's here now. Every dollar and year we invest must maximize carbon reduction. My opponent claims we present a \"false dichotomy,\" yet the evidence is clear: renewable deployment is outpacing nuclear worldwide precisely because it delivers faster, cheaper carbon reductions.\n\nMy opponent dismisses intermittency concerns without acknowledging remarkable advances in grid integration. Countries like Denmark (63% wind power) and regions of Australia (over 60% renewables) are already demonstrating high renewable penetration without reliability issues. Meanwhile, battery costs have fallen 89% in just ten years, with grid-scale storage deployments doubling annually.\n\nThe \"theoretical\" label absolutely applies to SMRs \u2013 not a single commercial SMR design has achieved widespread deployment or economic viability. We cannot base our climate strategy on promises while ignoring proven solutions.\n\nNuclear's proponents consistently underestimate its true costs. The UK's Hinkley Point C requires electricity prices more than twice the cost of new renewables to be viable. This pattern repeats globally.\n\nClimate change demands we maximize carbon reduction per dollar invested, as quickly as possible. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that renewable energy, coupled with storage and grid modernization, delivers more climate benefit faster than nuclear power. While nuclear may play a supporting role, it simply cannot be considered \"the best\" solution when more effective alternatives exist.",
