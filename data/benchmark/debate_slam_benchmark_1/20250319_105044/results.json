        "current_argument": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn this final round, I urge you to consider the comprehensive benefits that tariffs bring to domestic industries and the nation as a whole. My opponent has presented historical examples and concerns, but I maintain that strategically applied tariffs are a crucial tool for our economic arsenal.\n\nFirstly, the historical comparison to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act is a stark oversimplification. The Great Depression was a result of multiple factors, not just tariffs. Today's targeted tariffs are vastly different from the broad, indiscriminate policies of the past. They are designed to address specific threats and imbalances, such as dumping or unfair subsidies.\n\nSecondly, the claim that tariffs lead to complacency is not universally applicable. While it's true that some industries may become complacent, others use the breathing space to invest, innovate, and grow. For instance, the U.S. automotive industry used tariff protections in the 1980s to revamp their operations and become more competitive.\n\nRegarding trade wars, yes, they are a risk. But clever diplomacy and strategic use of tariffs can mitigate this risk. Moreover, backing down from protecting vital industries due to fear of retaliation is akin to conceding defeat without a fight.\n\nLastly, while long-term strategies like workforce training and R&D investment are essential, they do not negate the need for immediate protection. Tariffs can act as a safety net while these long-term strategies are being implemented.\n\nIn conclusion, tariffs are not a panacea but a necessary tool in our trade policy kit. They promote fair competition, protect jobs, and bolster national security. Let's not dismiss their usefulness based on historical oversimplifications or unfounded fears. Instead, let's use them judiciously to support our domestic industries. Thank you.",

        "current_argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, I urge you to consider the overwhelming evidence against using tariffs to protect domestic industries.\n\nMy opponent argues for \"strategically applied\" tariffs, but history shows this is easier said than done. Even targeted tariffs often have unintended consequences. For example, the 2018 US steel tariffs were meant to boost the domestic steel industry, but instead led to higher costs for American manufacturers and consumers, job losses in steel-using industries, and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners.\n\nThe claim that tariffs provide a \"safety net\" for industries to innovate is not supported by evidence. Studies consistently show that increased competition, not protection, drives innovation. The success of the U.S. auto industry in the 1980s was due to fundamental restructuring and learning from more efficient foreign competitors, not tariffs.\n\nMoreover, tariffs violate the principle of comparative advantage, which has been a cornerstone of economic growth for centuries. They artificially prop up inefficient industries at the expense of sectors where we have a natural advantage.\n\nInstead of tariffs, we should focus on policies that enhance our global competitiveness: investing in education and skills training, supporting R&D, improving infrastructure, and negotiating fair trade agreements. These approaches create sustainable growth without the harmful side effects of tariffs.\n\nIn conclusion, while protecting domestic industries is a laudable goal, tariffs are a flawed and counterproductive tool. Let's embrace smarter, forward-thinking policies that truly strengthen our economy in the long run. Thank you.",
