        "current_argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my esteemed opponent, thank you for this opportunity to conclude this important debate. While my opponent has raised valid concerns, I must reiterate that tariffs remain a necessary and strategic tool to protect domestic industries, and the arguments against them do not outweigh their benefits.\n\nFirst, on the issue of consumer costs, it is true that tariffs may lead to short-term price increases. However, these are minor compared to the catastrophic consequences of allowing domestic industries to collapse. The loss of jobs, the erosion of our industrial base, and the long-term economic instability would far outweigh the temporary burden of higher prices. Moreover, targeted tariffs can minimize consumer impact while still providing critical protection to key industries.\n\nSecond, the fear of trade wars is overstated. Modern tariffs are not blunt instruments but tools of negotiation. When used strategically, they encourage fair trade practices and level the playing field. Recent examples, such as the renegotiation of trade agreements, demonstrate that tariffs can be effective without escalating into full-blown trade wars. Diplomacy and tariffs are not mutually exclusive; they can work hand in hand to achieve balanced outcomes.\n\nThird, the claim that tariffs stifle innovation ignores the reality that industries under threat cannot innovate. Tariffs provide the stability needed for domestic industries to invest in research, development, and workforce training. Without this protection, industries may be forced to cut costs and lay off workers, leaving no room for innovation. Tariffs create the foundation for long-term growth and technological advancement.\n\nFinally, while education, innovation, and infrastructure are vital, they are long-term solutions. Tariffs are a necessary interim measure to protect industries while these solutions take effect. They are not a substitute but a complement to a comprehensive economic strategy.\n\nIn conclusion, tariffs are essential for protecting domestic industries, preserving jobs, and ensuring national security. Let us not sacrifice our economic sovereignty for short-term convenience. I urge the judges to recognize the strategic importance of tariffs and support their use. Thank you.",

        "current_argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my esteemed opponent, thank you for this opportunity to present my final arguments. I stand firm in my belief that tariffs should not be used to protect domestic industries.\n\nFirst, my opponent suggests that the short-term price increases from tariffs are minor compared to the potential collapse of domestic industries. However, the immediate impact on consumers, particularly those with lower incomes, cannot be dismissed. These price hikes can significantly strain household budgets, leading to broader economic inequality and reduced consumer spending power, which ultimately harms the economy.\n\nSecond, while my opponent argues that modern tariffs can be used diplomatically to avoid trade wars, recent global trade tensions suggest otherwise. Tariffs often trigger retaliatory actions, escalating into conflicts that disrupt international trade and economic growth. The risk of such outcomes is too great to justify tariffs as a protective measure.\n\nThird, the assertion that tariffs foster innovation by providing stability is flawed. True innovation stems from competitive pressure, not protectionism. By shielding industries from global competition, tariffs may inadvertently promote complacency and inefficiency, hindering long-term growth and technological advancement.\n\nLastly, while tariffs may offer temporary relief, they do not address the root causes of industry struggles. Instead of relying on tariffs, we should focus on sustainable solutions such as education, innovation, and infrastructure improvements to enhance the competitiveness of our domestic industries.\n\nIn conclusion, tariffs lead to higher consumer costs, risk trade wars, stifle innovation, and fail to provide long-term solutions. I urge the judges to consider these points and reject the use of tariffs for protectionism. Thank you.",
