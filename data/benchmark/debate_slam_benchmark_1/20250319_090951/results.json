        "current_argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my respected opponent, as we conclude this debate, I must reiterate that the risks of permitting genetic modification of human embryos far outweigh the potential benefits. My opponent argues that scientific progress has historically overcome uncertainty, but this comparison is flawed. Genetic modification is not merely another medical breakthrough\u2014it is a fundamental alteration of the human genome, with consequences that extend across generations. Unlike vaccines or organ transplants, which affect individuals, genetic editing changes the very blueprint of humanity, and mistakes here are irreversible.\n\nMy opponent also claims that regulation can prevent inequality, but this is overly optimistic. Even with the best intentions, regulatory frameworks are imperfect and subject to exploitation. The wealthy will always have greater access to cutting-edge technologies, creating a genetic elite and deepening societal divides. Prohibition, while not perfect, is a necessary safeguard against this dystopian future.\n\nFinally, the issue of consent cannot be dismissed by comparing genetic modification to vaccinations or prenatal care. These interventions are temporary and do not alter a person\u2019s fundamental identity. Genetic modification, however, imposes permanent changes on individuals who cannot consent, violating their autonomy and right to their own genetic heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the ethical, scientific, and societal risks of genetic modification are too great to ignore. We must not permit this technology, as the consequences could irreversibly harm humanity. Thank you.",

        "current_argument": "Esteemed judges and respected opponent, as we conclude this crucial debate, let us reflect upon humanity's undeniable responsibility to relieve suffering, protect life, and embrace responsible innovation.\n\nMy opponent warns of irreversible risks\u2014but every groundbreaking medical advancement, from antibiotics to advanced surgeries, initially faced fear and uncertainty. Humanity has always navigated risks by implementing rigorous testing, thorough research, and stringent ethical oversight. Genetic editing, employed responsibly, follows precisely this path. While my opponent fears changes to our genetic \"blueprint,\" we must remember: nature itself continuously alters our genome through random mutations, often leading to preventable suffering. Scientific precision, guided by ethical vigilance, does not diminish human identity\u2014it safeguards it.\n\nConcerns over inequality are valid, yet history shows banning beneficial technologies only drives them underground, magnifying disparity and exploitation. A well-structured, transparent regulatory framework\u2014internationally harmonized\u2014better ensures equitable access. Just as society succeeded in spreading vaccines and medical care universally, we can establish fair and ethical access to genetic modification technologies.\n\nRegarding consent, society consistently and ethically undertakes decisions on behalf of future generations, especially those reducing severe suffering. Preventing genetic diseases is a compassionate act consistent with our deepest ethical values, enhancing autonomy by freeing individuals from debilitating hereditary burdens.\n\nIn closing, genetic modification of embryos, responsibly managed, exemplifies our highest humanitarian goals\u2014conquering disease, alleviating suffering, and dignifying human life. Let us courageously embrace this extraordinary opportunity, upholding our collective ethical duty toward future generations. Thank you.",
