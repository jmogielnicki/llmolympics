        "submission": "In the embrace of autumn's whispered chill,  \nThe forest sheds its golden, fiery gown,  \nA dance of leaves that flutter, fall, and spill,  \nThey paint the earth in russet, red, and brown.  \n\nBeneath the boughs, a river's gentle sweep,  \nReflects the sky's descent from bold to gray,  \nIn every ripple, secrets old and deep,  \nTransforming night into the hopeful day.  \n\nThe mountains clad in winter's purest shroud,  \nStand guard as silent sentinels of time,  \nTheir icy breath commands the drifting cloud,  \nEach peak and vale a muse, a sage, a rhyme.  \n\nThrough nature's change, my spirit finds its way,  \nShedding the past, like trees in fall decay."

        "submission": "I walked the woods when spring was young and shy,  \nBeneath new leaves that whispered tales of growth;  \nWithin the bud, I glimpsed a butterfly,  \nEmerging bright, released from winter's oath.  \n\nThe river, thawing, coursed with fierce intent,  \nIts currents carving pathways ever new;  \nMy spirit, drifting restless yet content,  \nFlowed onward, changed by waters swift and true.  \n\nWhen autumn came, the trees unmasked their fire,  \nBrave shedding leaves amid the falling cold;  \nA courage kindled, born from earth's desire,  \nTo strip away the old, embrace the bold.  \n\nAs nature shifts, transforms beneath the sun,  \nSo too shall I, reborn, becoming one."

        "submission": "As winter's frost recedes from barren ground,\nThe dormant seeds awaken from their sleep.\nNew life emerges, stretching skyward bound,\nWhile I, too, from my slumber slowly creep.\n\nThe budding trees inspire my own growth,\nTheir branches reaching ever toward the light.\nLike them, I shed the old, renew my oath,\nTo blossom fully, standing tall and bright.\n\nThe rushing stream erodes the hardened stone,\nIts patient force reshaping all it meets.\nI let its lessons carve away my own\nRigid edges, as transformation fleets.\n\nThrough nature's change, I find my truest form,\nReborn, like spring, after the winter's storm."
