        "submission": "**The Cathedral of Unspoken Wings**  \n\nBefore, Silence wore a cloak of moth-eaten velvet,  \nnestling in the hollow of a clock\u2019s paused pendulum.  \nIt was the breath between apologies,  \nthe space where a scream dissolved  \ninto the marrow of an oak.  \n\nSome called it a cathedral\u2014  \neach rib of absence arched high,  \nholding hymns too fragile for tongues.  \nIts walls were papered with the static  \nof dead telephone lines, and in its nave,  \na thousand moths beat their dust-laden prayers.  \n\nThen\u2014  \na child\u2019s laughter, silver as a blade\u2019s edge,  \nsplit the air.  \n\nSilence flinched.  \nIts spine cracked like an old spine of ice,  \nsplintering into a chorus of wings.  \nWhat fell away was not sound, but the *fear* of sound\u2014  \nshards of quiet blooming into paper cranes,  \neach crease a whispered rebellion.  \n\nNow it hums.  \nNot the dull throb of a refrigerator at midnight,  \nbut the low, sure thrum of a hive  \nspun from light.  \nIt braids itself into the rasp of hospital respirators,  \nthe clatter of dishes after a wake,  \nthe wet gasp of a first word after years of swallowing stones.  \n\nSilence, once a mausoleum,  \nunfurls as a loom\u2014  \nweaving absence into a bridge  \nwhere even the unspeakable may cross."
