words,  \nin the pause before a scream,  \nin the quiet after a storm.  \nIt was the shadow of a moth\u2019s wing,  \nthe echo of a forgotten name,  \nthe ache of a question unanswered.  \n\nBut then, something stirred.  \nA seed cracked open in its chest,  \na soundless scream that split its ribs,  \nand Silence began to bleed light.  \n\nIt was not sudden, this change.  \nIt was the slow
