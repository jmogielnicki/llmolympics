        "submission": "In the hush of the morning, silence drapes  \nlike an invisible cloak over the waking world,  \nits fabric woven from threads of dew  \nand the slow exhale of night.  \n\nEmotions drift, unanchored as autumn leaves,  \ntheir colors unseen, yet they crunch underfoot,  \nstirring echoes of forgotten laughter,  \nold promises, now ghosts in the golden air.  \n\nDreams unfurl like banners in a mind's mist,  \ntheir whispers weaving tales the day ignores,  \ntapestries of yesterdays and tomorrows,  \nstitched into the lining of closed eyelids.  \n\nTime tiptoes past, a dancer in shadow shoes,  \nher footsteps leaving ripples in the pond of now,  \nunseen yet touching each face with brushes  \nof light and dark, pigments of memory.  \n\nListen to the wind's myriad voices, each one  \na solitary note in an orchestra of stillness;  \nit carries the taste of nostalgia, sweet and tart,  \nlike citrus aged in a sunbeam's gaze.  \n\nSilence, the color of midwinter twilight,  \ndrapes over thoughts like soft velvet,  \nits touch not felt but absorbed,  \nseeping through the marrow of thought.  \n\nAnd in the end, as the unseen unfolds,  \nlike a map unrolled from horizon to heart,  \nwe find the universe hidden in a sigh,  \nechoes of stars, seen only by the soul.  \n\nYet, it is in this unseen, unfelt realm,  \nwhere the soul learns to speak without voice,  \nand we find that what isn't seen with the eyes,  \ncan be felt, most profoundly, through the skin of the soul.  \n\nThe world spins its wonders, cloaked in the unseen,  \nand perhaps it is the silence between notes,  \nor the pause between heartbeats,  \nwhere we learn the truest song."

        "submission": "The Whispers of What's Unseen\n\nMemories float like dust motes in sunbeams,\nInvisible until caught in the light of remembrance.\nEach speck a story, suspended in the air of yesterday.\n\nSilence stretches between us like spun sugar,\nDelicate and sweet, yet liable to dissolve \nAt the slightest touch of sound.\n\nTime flows like underground rivers,\nCarving caverns in the bedrock of our lives,\nIts passage felt but never glimpsed.\n\nThe weight of words unspoken \nHangs heavy as rain-swollen clouds,\nA pressure building behind pursed lips.\n\nAnd dreams? They're smoke signals \nRising from the campfires of our subconsciousness,\nConveying messages we can't quite translate.\n\nBut perhaps the truly unseen\nIs not what's hidden from our eyes,\nBut what we've trained ourselves not to notice."

        "submission": "In the quiet corners of the mind, whispers weave a tapestry unseen,\nThreads of memories, delicate and fleeting, dance like fireflies in twilight's sheen.\nThe weight of a forgotten promise, heavy as a stone submerged in a silent lake,\nSinks deep into the soul, leaving ripples that only the heart can trace.\n\nThe sound of a shadow, a soft rustle, like the sigh of autumn leaves,\nMoves through the corridors of time, a melody that the eye perceives.\nThe taste of nostalgia, bittersweet as the last drop of honeyed wine,\nLingers on the tongue, a flavor that memories alone can refine.\n\nThe color of silence, a palette of hushed hues, deep and vast,\nSpreads across the canvas of the unseen, a masterpiece of the past.\nIn the language of the unseen, emotions paint with invisible ink,\nStories untold, dreams unwoven, on the brink of what we think.\n\nYet, in this realm of the intangible, where the unnoticed reigns supreme,\nLies the truth that what is unseen often holds the most potent dream.\nFor it is in the spaces between, in the whispers and the sighs,\nThat we find the essence of life, the unseen force that never dies."
