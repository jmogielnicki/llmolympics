        "submission": "In verdant gown of spring, she dances,\nA nymph in green, with blossoms in her hair,\nShe paints the meadows bright with daffodils,\nAnd weaves a melody with songbirds fair.\n\nThe brook awakes from winter's icy slumber,\nA silver thread that mirrors skies above,\nIt whispers tales of time's eternal plunder,\nAnd sings a lullaby to winter's dove.\n\nYet soon, the green goddess must surrender,\nHer reign is brief, like dawn's ephemeral glow,\nFor summer's king, in robes of golden splendor,\nAscends the throne, as calendulas grow.\n\nHe reigns with warmth, a fiery passion burning,\nThe sun, his crown, in azure skies so high,\nBut even kings must face the wheel's eternal turning,\nAs autumn's breath begins to whisper nigh.\n\nShe drifts in cloaks of crimson and of amber,\nA queen of twilight, bearing harvest's fruit,\nHer sighs are heard in every leaf's descent, remember,\nThe seasons' dance, no soul can absolutey mute.\n\nThe calendar, a testament to change,\nEach page a leaf that echoes nature's call,\nAnd every sunset, in its hues, a range\nOf seasons past, a nostalgic thrall.\n\nFor in this waltz of seasons, we discover,\nA longing for what's lost, a yearning deep,\nAs winter's shroud of white descends to cover\nThe world in slumber, secrets to keep.\n\nYet fear not, child, for spring will rise again,\nAnd with it, hope, like crocuses, will bloom,\nFor time may pass, but every ending ken\nA beginning new, in endless, ageless room."

        "submission": "The gold of Autumn, rich and deep,\nBegan to falter, start to sleep.\nThe amber leaves, like coins of old,\nReleased their grip, and stories told\nOf summer's green, a vibrant hue,\nNow fading fast, as days withdrew.\n\nThe wind, a breath both sharp and cold,\nWhispered of tales yet to unfold.\nThe sun, a clock in hurried flight,\nMarked shorter days and longer night.\nThen silver frost, a sudden sign,\nThat winter's hand, would soon be mine.\n\nThe white of winter, pure and bright,\nDescended softly in the night.\nA hush fell on the sleeping land,\nAs time stood still, in frozen sand.\nThough warmth is lost, and green is gone,\nA quiet beauty, lingers on."
