our shadows might cast\nif we finally released them into light.\n\nWhat histories might we rewrite\nif we excavated these buried treasures?\nWhat wounds might heal\nif we finally named them?\n\nI practice sometimes, alone in empty rooms,\nforming the syllables carefully with my tongue.\nThe silence after feels different\u2014\nexpectant, like soil after rain.\n\nTomorrow, perhaps, I'll speak them.\nTomorrow, I'll let them breathe.\nFor now, they nest in my chest,\nthese unhatched birds of truth,\nwaiting for wings."}, "voting_responses": {"player_1": "player_2", "player_2": "player_6",
