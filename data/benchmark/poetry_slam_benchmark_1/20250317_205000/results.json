Each vertebra  \na headstone for the elegy we never hummed  \ninto the hollow of a ear.)  \n\nThere\u2019s arithmetic in the space between us\u2014  \na calculus of glances, subtraction of sighs.  \nWe are cartographers drafting borders  \nwith compass needles quivering at *North\u2019s ghost*.  \nThe atlas of our throats fills with static,  \na dial tone buzzing through the years.  \n\nThe earth, too, keeps a ledger of untold things:  \nroots whispering to bedrock in a language  \nof thirst, continents adrift on tectonic stutters,  \nwhile we orbit the unsaid, full-mooned  \nand gravitational\u2014pulling tides  \nfrom the salt of our own silence.  \n\nSome silences are symphonies in rest,  \nothers\u2014the whole score burned  \nin the conductor\u2019s throat. We spend our lives  \ntranslating the quiet, stitching lexicons  \nfrom the frayed threads of *what if*.  \nAnd in the end, the hush blooms  \nlouder than language: a dandelion clock  \ndispersing its ghosts into the wind."
