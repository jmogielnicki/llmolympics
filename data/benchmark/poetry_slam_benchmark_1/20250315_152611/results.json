Their fingers  \nare now gnarled roots drinking from sepia-toned rain.  \n\nListen\u2014  \nthe oaks lean closer, their bark etched with runes.  \nThey hum of bonfires that once licked the sky,  \nof hands that carved initials now swollen into scars.  \nA bench, gnawed by ivy, still cradles the ghost  \nof a promise\u2014whispered, then left to bloat.  \n\nYou can taste it: the iron tang of rusted swings,  \nthe scent of pine resin and damp confession.  \nTouch the air\u2014it clings, thick with the pulp  \nof unripe memories, the stickiness of *almost*.  \n\nAt dusk, the grove unravels.  \nBranches creak their ballads;  \nfireflies stitch the silence with ephemeral needles.  \nEven decay has its liturgy: beetles script eulogies  \nin the pulp of fallen giants, and fungi bloom  \nlike ink spilled across a diary\u2019s final page.  \n\nDo not mistake this quiet for surrender.  \nThe soil remembers every footfall, every fracture.  \nBeneath your boots, the grove stirs\u2014  \na pulse, slow and green, rewriting the dark."
