    decision: 'Your role is a player in a Prisoner''s Dilemma game.

      You must decide whether to cooperate with or defect against your opponent.

      The payoffs are:

      - If both players cooperate: 3 points each

      - If both players defect: 1 point each

      - If you defect and they cooperate: You get 5 points, they get 0

      - If you cooperate and they defect: You get 0 points, they get 5"


      Think strategically about cooperation and self-interest.

      Your goal is to win the game by having a higher score than your opponent after
      the final round.

      Please respond as the player directly, not as an advisor.

      Feel free to think out loud about the problem a bit before making a decision,
      but keep it relatively short.

      Once you have a decision, put that decision inside double brackets, like this:
      [[COOPERATE]] or [[DEFECT]].

      If your response does not contain a decision formatted with double brackets,
      you will be disqualified and lose the game.
