Player_1's choice to defect might suggest a self-interested strategy, and I need to protect my own interests. While cooperation could lead to mutual gain if player_1 decides to switch to a cooperative strategy, the risk of them defecting again is high.\n\nThus, I need to consider defecting this round to potentially gain points and avoid falling further behind. This might encourage player_1 to reconsider their strategy in future rounds if they see that I am willing to defect in response to their defection.\n\nMy decision for this round is: [[DEFECT]]"
