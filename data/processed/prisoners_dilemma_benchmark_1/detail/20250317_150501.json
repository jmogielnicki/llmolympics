If I defect and they cooperate, I get 5 points while they get nothing. However, if we both defect, we only get 1 point each, which is worse than mutual cooperation.\n\nSince this is a repeated game with 5 rounds, there's value in establishing cooperative behavior early. If I can build trust with my opponent, we might both choose to cooperate in future rounds, maximizing our joint score. Starting with cooperation signals my willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n\nOf course, there's risk involved - my opponent might defect in this first round, leaving me with 0 points.
