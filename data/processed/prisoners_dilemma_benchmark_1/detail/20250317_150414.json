Since this is a multi-round game, there's value in building trust. Starting with cooperation signals my willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n\nI think the best strategy for the first round is to cooperate and then respond based on what my opponent does in subsequent rounds. This approach gives us the opportunity to establish a cooperative relationship while still allowing me to protect myself if my opponent proves untrustworthy.\n\n[[COOPERATE]]"
