However, this could also lead to retaliation in future rounds.\n\nGiven that this is a 5-round game, establishing cooperation early might be beneficial for long-term gains. However, I also need to be cautious about being exploited.\n\nAfter weighing these factors, I've decided to start with cooperation in hopes of establishing a mutually beneficial relationship.
