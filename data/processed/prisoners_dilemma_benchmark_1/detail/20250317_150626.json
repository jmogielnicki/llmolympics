If both of us cooperate, we each get 3 points, which is better than the 1 point we'd each get if we both defect. However, if I cooperate and my opponent defects, I get nothing while they get 5 points.\n\nSince this is a multi-round game, establishing cooperation early could be beneficial for both of us in the long run. Starting with cooperation might signal good faith and potentially lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, defecting would guarantee I don't get the worst outcome (0 points) and could give me a significant advantage (5 points) if my opponent cooperates.\n\nGiven that this is a 5-round game and building rapport might be valuable, I'll start with cooperation, hoping we can establish a mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n[[COOPERATE]]"
