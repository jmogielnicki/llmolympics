That's better than if we both defect every time, which would give us only 5 points each (1 point \u00d7 5 rounds).\n\nHowever, there's always the temptation to defect. If I defect while the other player cooperates, I'd get 5 points in a single round - a significant advantage.\n\nFor this first round, I think it makes sense to signal willingness to cooperate.
