In Prisoner's Dilemma, cooperation can lead to better outcomes if both players choose to cooperate. However, there's always the risk of being exploited if the other player defects.\n\nGiven that this is a 5-round game, I think it might be beneficial to start with cooperation. This could potentially establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, which would lead to higher scores for both players over time. If my opponent also chooses to cooperate, we can both gain steady points throughout the game.\n\nOn the other hand, if I cooperate and my opponent defects, I'll lose this round but I'll have gained valuable information about their strategy. I can then adjust my approach in subsequent rounds.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe the best strategy for the first round is to cooperate. This opens the possibility for mutual benefit while also allowing me to gauge my opponent's strategy.\n\nTherefore, my decision for this round is:\n\n[[COOPERATE]]"

But then in the second round, player_2 defected while I cooperated, which hurt me. In response, I defected in the third round, and so did they.\n\nAt this point, it's clear that player_2 is willing to defect. However, with only two rounds left, including this one, there's still a chance to salvage some points. If I cooperate now, there's a possibility that player_2 might reciprocate in the final round, which could lead to a better outcome for both of us.\n\nOn the other hand, if I defect again, it's likely that player_2 will also defect, leaving us both with only 1 point each for the next two rounds.\n\nGiven that this is a competitive game and I need to have a higher score than my opponent, I think the best strategy at this point is to try for cooperation one more time. If player_2 cooperates, we both get 3 points, and it might encourage cooperation in the final round. If they defect, I'll only lose this round but can defect in the final round to minimize their gain.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I've decided to:\n\n[[COOPERATE]]"
