I ended up with 0 points while they gained 5. This suggests that player_2 might be inclined to try and maximize their immediate gains, possibly at the expense of cooperation.\n\nHowever, there's still a strategic element to consider. If I defect now, I can secure at least 1 point, regardless of whether they cooperate or defect, though I might miss out on the potential mutual benefit if player_2 decides to cooperate this time. Conversely, if I cooperate again, I put myself at risk of further exploitation but offer a chance to establish trust and potentially gain more points in subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven that player_2 has shown a willingness to defect, my best move could be to defect this round to protect against further losses and see if their strategy shifts. \n\nTherefore, my decision for this round is: [[DEFECT]]"
