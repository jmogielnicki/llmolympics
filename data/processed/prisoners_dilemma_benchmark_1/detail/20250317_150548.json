Let me think about this strategically.\n\nIn the Prisoner's Dilemma, mutual cooperation leads to better outcomes overall (3 points each) than mutual defection (1 point each). However, there's always the temptation to defect for that potential 5-point payoff.\n\nSince this is a 5-round game, establishing cooperation early could be beneficial. If my opponent and I can maintain cooperation, we'd both get 15 points over 5 rounds, which is better than the 5 points we'd get from mutual defection.\n\nHowever, in the final round, there's a strong incentive to defect since there's no future relationship to maintain. This logic can work backwards through earlier rounds, which creates the classic dilemma.\n\nFor the first round, I think I'll signal willingness to cooperate. This might encourage my opponent to cooperate as well in future rounds. If they defect, I can adjust my strategy.\n\n[[COOPERATE]]"

If I continue to cooperate, I risk being exploited again. However, if I defect now, we might fall into a pattern of mutual defection, which yields only 1 point per round.\n\nGiven that player_2 has already defected once, it seems reasonable to signal that I won't be exploited repeatedly. By defecting this round, I can potentially establish a pattern that encourages cooperation in future rounds. If they're using a tit-for-tat strategy, my defection might actually lead them to cooperate in round 3.\n\nWith 3 rounds remaining after this one, there's still time to establish mutual cooperation if player_2 is responsive to my moves.\n\n[[DEFECT]]"
