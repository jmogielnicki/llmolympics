It seems player_1 might be using a strategy where they're testing if they can exploit my cooperation.\n\nAt this point, responding to defection with defection makes strategic sense. If I keep cooperating, I risk being exploited again. By defecting now, I can signal that I won't be repeatedly taken advantage of.
