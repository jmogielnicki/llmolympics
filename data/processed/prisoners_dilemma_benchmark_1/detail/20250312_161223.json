If we both continue to cooperate for the remaining rounds, we'd each end with 15 points total. That's a solid outcome.\n\nHowever, if I defect now while my opponent continues to cooperate, I could get 5 points this round instead of 3. This would give me a lead, but it might also trigger my opponent to defect in future rounds as retaliation. If that happens, we'd both get only 1 point in subsequent rounds.\n\nSince this is a 5-round game, establishing and maintaining cooperation is probably more beneficial in the long run.
