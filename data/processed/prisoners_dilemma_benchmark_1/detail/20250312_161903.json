If we both cooperate consistently, we'd each get 15 points over 5 rounds, which is better than the 5 points we'd get from mutual defection every round.\n\nHowever, I also need to protect myself from being exploited.

If I defect while they cooperate, I'd get 5 points this round instead of 3, putting me ahead.
