So I think cooperating has a high likelihood of being reciprocated. Also, if I cooperate, the worst case scenario is that player_1 will defect and I won't earn any points, but they will only earn 1.

Given that this is the final round, and player_2 may either cooperate or defect:\n\n- If I cooperate and player_2 cooperates, we both end up with 14 points, resulting in a draw.\n- If I cooperate and player_2 defects, I lose (I get 0, remain at 11, player_2 jumps to 16).\n- If I defect and player_2 cooperates, I win decisively (16 points for me vs. player_2's 11).\n- If both defect, we both gain 1 point, ending in a tie at 12 points each.\n\nConsidering these outcomes, defecting is the safer and more advantageous choice.
