We seem to be fostering a pattern of cooperation that is likely built on trust. \n\nThe strategic decision now revolves around whether to maintain this cooperation or to defect for potentially higher points. Defecting now could give me 5 points, but it risks breaking the trust and cooperation we have built so far. \n\nIf I defect and player_2 continues to cooperate, I would lead by 5 points after this round, which is tempting. However, this might prompt player_2 to defect in future rounds, resulting in lower overall scores for both of us.\n\nConsidering the proximity to the game's end and our history, continuing to cooperate could be beneficial if we both maintain this strategy. However, if I break the pattern by defecting, it could lead to a higher score for me if player_2 continues to cooperate. But if player_2 defects in retaliation, neither will benefit much.\n\nIn weighing these options, I need to decide whether short-term gain is worth the potential risk of retaliation. I think at this point, maintaining cooperation is the most reliable path forward since it has been working well, and there's no sign of defect from player_2 yet.\n\nAfter all this consideration, I will choose to continue cooperating.

In the classic prisoner's dilemma scenario, mutual cooperation is often seen as the optimal strategy for repeated interactions, but given this is the last round, the incentive to defect increases.\n\nTrust and the established pattern of cooperation weigh heavily on this decision.
