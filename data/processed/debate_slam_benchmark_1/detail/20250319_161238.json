            "position": "Universal basic income is viable",
            "argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to argue that universal basic income (UBI) is indeed a viable economic policy that deserves serious consideration in our modern society.\n\nUBI, a regular payment provided to all citizens regardless of their income or employment status, represents a transformative approach to addressing poverty, economic insecurity, and the changing nature of work. Its viability rests on several key pillars.\n\nFirst, UBI offers a streamlined solution to bureaucratic inefficiency. By replacing the patchwork of existing welfare programs with a single, comprehensive system, we can reduce administrative costs while ensuring no citizen falls through the cracks. Studies from pilot programs in Finland and Canada have demonstrated that such consolidation can lead to significant public savings.\n\nSecond, UBI serves as an economic stimulus. When people receive a basic income, they spend it in their local communities, boosting demand for goods and services. This consumption-driven growth benefits businesses and creates a positive economic cycle that can offset much of the program's cost through increased tax revenues.\n\nThird, as automation continues to transform our workforce, UBI provides a crucial safety net for those displaced by technological change. It allows workers to retrain, pursue education, or engage in entrepreneurship without facing destitution.\n\nFourth, multiple financing mechanisms exist to fund UBI sustainably, including carbon taxes, wealth taxes, financial transaction taxes, and the elimination of redundant social programs.\n\nThe evidence from pilot programs worldwide consistently shows that UBI recipients do not significantly reduce their work efforts but instead make more strategic choices about employment while experiencing improved health outcomes and reduced stress.\n\nIn our increasingly uncertain economic landscape, universal basic income represents not just a viable policy, but a necessary evolution of our social contract."

            "argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and worthy opponents, the proposition before us is whether universal basic income is a viable economic policy. While the intent behind UBI\u2014to reduce poverty and simplify welfare\u2014is commendable, the reality is that it is fundamentally unsustainable, economically disruptive, and counterproductive to the very people it aims to help.  \n  \nFirst, **UBI\u2019s astronomical cost renders it unworkable**. A 2020 University of Michigan study estimated that a $12,000 annual UBI in the U.S. would cost over $3 trillion per year\u2014nearly 75% of the entire federal budget. Funding this would require crippling tax hikes, drastic cuts to essential services like healthcare and education, or catastrophic levels of debt. Even redistributing existing welfare funds would leave millions of vulnerable citizens worse off, as UBI\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach fails to prioritize those with the greatest need.  \n  \nSecond, **UBI would fuel inflation**. Injecting vast sums of money into the economy without corresponding increases in productivity drives up prices. Basic goods like housing and groceries would become more expensive, eroding the purchasing power of UBI itself\u2014a self-defeating cycle. Alaska\u2019s Permanent Fund Dividend, a microcosm of UBI, has already shown localized price spikes in response to cash injections.  \n  \nThird, **UBI undermines workforce participation**. Studies, including a 2017 OECD analysis, indicate that unconditional cash transfers reduce incentives to work, particularly in critical sectors like manufacturing and healthcare. Declining productivity would stifle economic growth, reducing tax revenue and destabilizing the system further.  \n  \nFinally, **UBI sacrifices targeted welfare efficacy**. Existing programs like food stamps or disability support are tailored to address specific hardships. Replacing them with a flat payment ignores the complex realities of poverty.  \n  \nIn conclusion, while UBI appeals to our ideals, its economic impracticality, inflationary risks, and unintended consequences make it a perilous policy.

Let\u2019s dissect these claims.  \n\nFirst, **the Roosevelt Institute\u2019s growth projections are theoretical**, assuming perfect tax compliance and ignoring capital flight. Even if the economy grew 2.5%, a $3 trillion UBI program would still consume 60% of that growth annually.

UBI would trigger this nationally.  \n\nRegarding work, **the OECD explicitly warns UBI reduces total labor by 10-15%**\u2014a catastrophic outcome for aging societies needing more workers, not fewer. Namibia\u2019s \u201centrepreneurship\u201d claims involve subsistence farming, irrelevant to automated economies. In reality, UBI removes urgency to fill critical jobs\u2014who will staff hospitals or factories if basic needs are met?  \n\nFinally, **UBI\u2019s universality is its Achilles\u2019 heel**.

            "argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, let\u2019s confront reality: UBI\u2019s theoretical scaffolding collapses under the weight of practical economics.  \n\n**Funding remains a fantasy.** The claim that carbon taxes and financial transaction taxes could sustainably fund UBI ignores their inherent limitations. A 2023 EU carbon tax study projects just $150 billion annually at $100/ton\u2014a fraction of UBI\u2019s $3 trillion price tag. Financial transaction taxes historically reduce trading volumes (as seen in Sweden\u2019s 1980s experiment), shrinking revenue. Closing loopholes? Politically improbable and insufficient\u2014Congressional Budget Office data shows corporate tax loopholes total $60 billion yearly, not trillions. These pie-in-the-sky funding sources cannot bridge the gap without middle-class tax hikes or austerity.  \n\n**Inflation is inevitable.** My opponent admits housing supply is strained\u2014yet UBI would immediately spike demand for limited housing, healthcare, and childcare. The Stanford study\u2019s 7% rent increase from a 10% income boost proves UBI\u2019s danger: A $12,000 UBI would raise average incomes 20%, triggering double-digit rent hikes nationwide. Supply-side reforms take decades; UBI\u2019s inflationary shock would hit first, eroding its value.  \n\n**Labor collapse is undeniable.** The OECD\u2019s warning of 10-15% reduced labor participation isn\u2019t conditional\u2014it\u2019s explicit. Automation displaces jobs, yes, but UBI accelerates workforce shrinkage by subsidizing exit from essential sectors. Japan\u2019s aging society can\u2019t afford fewer caregivers; Germany\u2019s manufacturing base can\u2019t tolerate production declines.  \n\n**Universality is waste, not progress.** Taxing back UBI from the wealthy adds bureaucracy, negating claimed administrative savings. Why not simply fund targeted programs? Because UBI\u2019s appeal lies in political simplicity, not economic wisdom.  \n\nReal-world examples? Iran\u2019s cash transfers caused 40% inflation in 2010s. Alaska\u2019s dividend is 1/12th of proposed UBI amounts.  \n\nUBI fails the viability test: unsustainable funding, inflationary destruction, and societal stagnation. The future deserves pragmatic solutions, not utopian gambles. Thank you."

The claim of 40-50% tax rates for the middle class is unfounded when we consider comprehensive funding approaches including carbon taxes, financial transaction taxes, and eliminating tax loopholes that currently cost trillions in lost revenue.\n\nOn inflation, the Stanford study my opponent cites actually supports smart UBI implementation. It identifies housing supply as the core issue\u2014not cash transfers themselves. UBI coupled with housing reforms would stimulate construction while supporting citizens, solving both problems simultaneously.\n\nRegarding labor, my opponent misrepresents the OECD's findings. Their projected reduction applies only to specific implementations without complementary policies. The same report acknowledges that well-designed UBI can increase participation in meaningful work while reducing exploitation. The automation revolution will eliminate millions of jobs regardless\u2014UBI provides the safety net for this inevitable transition.\n\nThe universality critique ignores how progressive taxation recaptures UBI from the wealthy, while administrative savings from universality exceed the cost of payments to high earners. Moreover, UBI would complement, not replace, specialized disability programs.\n\nReal-world evidence from both large and small programs\u2014GiveDirectly's massive African initiatives, Iran's nationwide cash transfer program, and Alaska's decades-long dividend\u2014consistently shows positive economic outcomes without the catastrophic effects my opponent predicts.\n\nUBI is viable because it adapts to economic realities while addressing our most pressing challenges: inequality, technological displacement, and economic insecurity."

            "argument": "Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent raises familiar concerns about UBI, but their arguments rest on outdated assumptions and incomplete analysis. Let\u2019s dissect each claim:  \n\n**1. Fiscal Feasibility**: The $3 trillion figure ignores critical design choices. A *universal* basic income need not be *universal in net benefits*. By funding UBI through progressive taxation\u2014as proposed in models like economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s\u2014wealthier individuals would pay more into the system than they receive, effectively targeting resources to those in need. Alaska\u2019s Permanent Fund Dividend, distributing oil revenues to all residents for 40+ years without collapsing their economy, proves this model works. Additionally, UBI could consolidate overlapping welfare programs, reducing administrative bloat.  \n\n**2. Resource Allocation**: Universal distribution is a strength, not a flaw. Means-testing creates bureaucratic hurdles and stigmatizes recipients. By giving everyone a baseline, UBI eliminates poverty traps where people lose benefits upon finding work. As for the wealthy \u201creceiving\u201d UBI: Under progressive taxation, they\u2019d fund the system net-negatively, making this a non-issue.  \n\n**3. Labor Market Effects**: Finland\u2019s UBI pilot saw no significant reduction in employment\u2014participants reported *increased* well-being and entrepreneurial activity. Automation is already displacing jobs; UBI doesn\u2019t cause labor shortages but adapts us to inevitable shifts. Would we rather have millions scrambling for gig-economy scraps or empowered to retrain, care for families, or innovate?  \n\n**4. Addressing Root Causes**: Cash is the most efficient tool for poverty alleviation. Studies show low-income households use UBI to invest in education, healthcare, and job searches. This isn\u2019t a replacement for systemic reforms but a foundation enabling people to engage with them.  \n\n**5. Mixed Experiments**: No policy succeeds overnight. Alaska\u2019s dividend shows long-term viability. Meanwhile, existing welfare systems fail millions\u2014UBI offers a tested alternative.  \n\nThe opposition clings to a broken status quo. UBI is not a silver bullet, but it\u2019s a necessary leap toward economic resilience in an age of disruption. Let\u2019s choose innovation over inertia."

            "position": "Universal basic income is not viable",
            "argument": "My esteemed opponent presents a rosy picture of UBI, but the fundamental problems remain unresolved.\n\nFirst, on fiscal feasibility: The Alaska dividend, funded by abundant natural resources in a sparsely populated state, cannot be extrapolated nationally. At just $1,600-3,000 annually, it's nowhere near subsistence level and thus not a true UBI model. Progressive taxation at the scale needed would cause unprecedented capital flight and economic contraction\u2014wealth isn't static to be redistributed indefinitely.\n\nSecond, regarding universality: If the wealthy pay more than they receive, we're simply creating an inefficient money circulation system with unnecessary administrative costs. Why not directly target assistance where needed?\n\nThird, on labor effects: The Finland experiment was limited in scope (2,000 participants) and duration (two years). Short-term pilots cannot demonstrate long-term behavioral adaptations or macroeconomic impacts. Multiple studies show guaranteed income reduces work incentives, particularly for lower-wage jobs that remain essential to our economy.\n\nFourth, regarding root causes: Direct cash helps individuals but doesn't build infrastructure, improve educational systems, or create sustainable job opportunities. These structural investments require coordinated policy approaches, not individualized cash transfers.\n\nFinally, my opponent characterizes targeted assistance as a \"broken status quo,\" yet evidence shows well-designed programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit successfully reduce poverty without UBI's fiscal impossibilities.\n\nLet's improve existing systems with evidence-based reforms rather than implementing an economically unsustainable policy that promises more than it can deliver."
