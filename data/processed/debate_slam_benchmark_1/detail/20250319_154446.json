The notion of eugenics is misleading here; the goal is not to create a \u201cbetter\u201d human but to eliminate avoidable suffering and disease. Genetic diversity is crucial, and it can thrive alongside responsible genetic interventions aimed at preventing suffering rather than dictating traits.\n\nSocial inequality indeed poses challenges, but these are not insurmountable. Proactive policy making and global cooperation can mitigate disparities, just as they have with other technological innovations. By working to make genetic interventions accessible, we can ensure that they serve as a universal boon rather than a divisive force.\n\nRegarding scientific uncertainties, advancing with rigorous, controlled research is crucial. The precautionary principle need not halt progress but should guide it safely. We already navigate uncertainties in medicine, always striving for solutions that benefit humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential for eradicating genetic diseases and improving human health is too significant to dismiss. With careful regulation, ethical foresight, and equitable distribution, genetic modification can be a force for immense good. Let us not hinder progress but harness it, ensuring a healthier future for all."

            "argument": "Esteemed judges, valued audience, and my opponent, as we conclude this debate, I must reaffirm that the genetic modification of human embryos should not be permitted.\n\nEthically, my opponent's argument that we must alleviate suffering is compelling, but it does not address the core issue: the subjective nature of deciding which traits to modify. This decision-making process inherently leads to eugenics, not merely disease prevention. The ethical line between preventing suffering and enhancing humans is blurred, risking a loss of genetic diversity and human dignity.\n\nOn the issue of social inequality, my opponent's faith in policy solutions underestimates the challenge. Genetic modifications create permanent biological advantages, which cannot be easily mitigated by policy. The genetic divide will persist, exacerbating social inequality and undermining the principle of equality.\n\nScientifically, my opponent's call for continued research under the precautionary principle is risky. The irreversible nature of genetic modifications means that any unintended consequences could affect future generations. The precautionary principle should lead us to pause, not proceed, when the stakes are so high and the outcomes so uncertain.\n\nIn closing, the ethical violations, social inequalities, and scientific risks associated with genetic modification of human embryos are too significant to ignore. We must prioritize ethical integrity, social equity, and scientific caution over potential benefits that remain speculative and fraught with danger. Therefore, I strongly argue that the genetic modification of human embryos should not be permitted."
