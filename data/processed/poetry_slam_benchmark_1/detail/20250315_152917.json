This could include love, grief, time, memory, wind, dreams, or even the quiet hum of the universe. Your poem should evoke the intangible, making the unseen *felt* through vivid imagery, metaphor, and sensory detail.  \n\n**Form and Style Requirements:**  \n- Use **free verse** (no strict rhyme or meter required).  \n- Incorporate at least **three contrasting senses** (e.g., sight, sound, touch) to bring the unseen to life.  \n- Include **one moment of personification**, giving human qualities to something abstract or inanimate.  \n\n**Example Inspiration:**  \n- The way grief feels like a shadow that lingers long after the sun has set.  \n- The sound of time slipping through your fingers like sand.  \n- The warmth of a memory you can\u2019t quite place.  \n\nLet your poem reveal the hidden beauty of what we cannot see but deeply feel.",
