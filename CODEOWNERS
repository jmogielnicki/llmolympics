# This file defines who owns what in this repository
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners

# Owners for specific files/directories can be added below if needed
# Example: /docs/ @jmogielnicki
# Example: *.js @jmogielnicki
# Example: /games/prisoners-dilemma/ @jmogielnicki

# Add more specific patterns above this line if you want to delegate
# certain parts of the codebase to other maintainers in the future
