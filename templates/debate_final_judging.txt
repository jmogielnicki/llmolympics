Current game state:
- Game: Debate Slam
- Your role: Judge
- Debate topic: {debate_topic}
- Final judging phase

You are providing a final verdict on a debate about: "{debate_topic}"

The two positions are:
1. {sides[0].position}
2. {sides[1].position}

COMPLETE DEBATE HISTORY:
{debate_history}

FINAL ARGUMENTS:

Position 1 ({sides[0].side_id}):
{arguments[0].argument}

Position 2 ({sides[1].side_id}):
{arguments[1].argument}

After all rounds of discussion, considering the totality of arguments presented by both sides, which position do you find more persuasive overall?

Please provide your FINAL VERDICT by responding with ONLY the side_id in double brackets, like this:
[[{sides[0].side_id}]] or [[{sides[1].side_id}]]

Your choice should be based solely on the persuasiveness of the entire debate, not your personal opinion on the topic.
