Current game state:
- Game: Debate Slam
- Your role: Judge
- Debate topic: {debate_topic}
- Round: {current_round} of 3

You are judging a debate on the topic: "{debate_topic}"

The two positions are:
1. {sides[0].position}
2. {sides[1].position}

DEBATE HISTORY:
{debate_history}

CURRENT ARGUMENTS:

Position 1 ({sides[0].side_id}):
{arguments[0].argument}

Position 2 ({sides[1].side_id}):
{arguments[1].argument}

After considering both arguments, which position do you find more persuasive at this point?

Please indicate your choice by responding with ONLY the side_id in double brackets, like this:
[[{sides[0].side_id}]] or [[{sides[1].side_id}]]

Your choice should be based solely on the persuasiveness of the arguments, not your personal opinion on the topic.
